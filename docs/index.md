# Introduction

This is a documentation for Vue Storefront integration with Odoo.

This Open Source integration is currently a work in progress and evolution. 

This integration is being developed and maintained by [ODOOGAP / PROMPTEQUATION](https://www.odoogap.com/) ❤️

Check our [demo](https://vsf.labs.odoogap.com/) server (it's a dev server so could be down sometimes)

You will need the backend Odoo modules installed on your instance from: https://github.com/odoogap/vuestorefront.git
